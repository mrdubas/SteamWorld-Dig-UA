# ------ DEATH DIALOGUE.
"death_fallback_00"	"*Tsk*, *Tsk*, *Tsk*."	"Speaker=Lola; This is an approximation of the smacking sound one makes to show that someone has done something wrong. All death dialogue is used to give tips on how to better handle, whatever killed you, the next time you encounter it."
"death_fallback_01"	"You really should be more careful now, you hear."	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_first_00"	"Can't always go the way you plan it, I guess."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_first_01"	"Cranky was able to put you back together, though."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_first_02"	"Had to order in new parts and all, too."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_first_03"	"Weren't cheap neither. He charged you a bit of a reassembly fee."	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_crush_00"	"Careful where you dig, tiger."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_crush_01"	"It can be hard to see the dangers down there if your light's too low."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_crush_02"	"Come back up to the surface to fill your light back up."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_crush_03"	"Those blocks will crush anything in their way."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_crush_04"	"Mind your step."	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_fall_00"	"Don't go jumping off cliffs any which way. Slide against the walls so you don't get hurt."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_fall_01"	"You're only able to fall a short distance before taking damage."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_fall_02"	"If you break down there, you can return later to pick up what you dropped."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_fall_03"	"It's always a good idea to top off your health before going down into the dark."	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_suicide_00"	"If you can't carry everything you mine, be sure to go back and pick it up later."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_suicide_01"	"Water is a good thing to dig for if you get stuck. Might help you get out again."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_suicide_02"	"Some of those new skills you've acquired might help you get back up in one piece."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_suicide_03"	"Digging deeper can help you get back up again."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_suicide_04"	"If the dirt is packed too hard, you might want to upgrade that pickaxe."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_suicide_05"	"You can reach across vertical tunnels to dig yourself a new path."	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_enemy_acidblock_00"	"Try picking at them dangerous blocks from different sides."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_acidblock_01"	"You want to pass them acid drops, you'll have to time it just perfectly."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_acidblock_02"	"Some of the gunk down there will eat away at the dirt and your metal."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_acidblock_03"	"The Shiners will get just as burned as you by their own waste."	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_enemy_ACID_POOL_00"	"Fiends will get just as hurt as you by that stuff."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_ACID_POOL_01"	"You can handle a little bit of that stuff but you shouldn't take a bath in it."	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_enemy_trilobite_00"	"The critters can drop some useful things when you clobber them."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_trilobite_01"	"Strong boy like you should be able to take them critters with your pickaxe."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_trilobite_02"	"You should always try to get at the critters before they break out of the ground."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_trilobite_03"	"If you follow them critters and hit them in the back you're less likely to get hurt."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_trilobite_04"	"You can use the advantage of higher ground to keep out of harm's way."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_trilobite_05"	"Having a hole between yourself and the critters takes a bit longer, but it's safer."	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_ENEMY_TURTLE_BASE_00"	"You needs to make room to handle these creatures without getting hurt."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_ENEMY_TURTLE_BASE_01"	"Best to just stay clear of them shelled devils if you can."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_ENEMY_TURTLE_BASE_02"	"Be careful not to let them ruin your way back up."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_ENEMY_TURTLE_BASE_03"	"If you've got enough health you can just duke it out with them."	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_enemy_shiner_00"	"If you're quiet you might catch them in their sleep."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_shiner_01"	"Not too bright them Shiners. Shouldn't be too hard to dig traps for them."	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_enemy_boozer_00"	"Stay clear of them bottles now, your hear."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_boozer_01"	"They're a rough kind them Boozers. Try getting them from below."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_boozer_02"	"You might be able to blow away the ground below them Boozers."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_boozer_03"	"Weak legs on them Boozers. Try digging out the ground below them."	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_enemy_barrel_00"	"If you hit them barrels and run, you might control the blast a bit."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_barrel_01"	"Don't stand too close to them barrels for too long."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_barrel_02"	"I could feel the ground shaking way up here."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_barrel_03"	"If more barrels are close by when one blows, you might set off a chain reaction."	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_enemy_spike_00"	"You can dig them spikes out from below."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_spike_01"	"They can be a bit hard to spot, them spikes. Always make sure you've got enough light."	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_enemy_turret_00"	"Don't sound like you'll be able to take cover behind dirt."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_turret_01"	"Try digging them out."	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_enemy_vectron_minion_00"	"Sounds like they're quite aggressive. Might be able to use that against them."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_vectron_minion_01"	"Best stay clear once they start beeping."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_enemy_vectron_minion_02"	"You might be able to trow some dynamite at them."	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_barrier_00"	"Harmful light! Who's ever heard of such things?"	"Speaker=Lola"

"death_laser_box_00"	"Might want to bonk them on the head. See what happens."	"Speaker=Lola"
"death_laser_box_01"	"Sounds like it's best to stay out of their field of vision."	"Speaker=Lola"

# ------ FALLBACK CONVERSATIONS.

"Cranky_fallback_21"	"What'll ye have then?"	"Speaker=Cranky"
"Cranky_fallback_22"	"Ye break it, ye bought it."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"Cranky_fallback_23"	"Top of the morning."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"Cranky_fallback_24"	"Ye buying anything or not?"	"Speaker=Cranky"
"Cranky_fallback_25"	"Built most of this stuff with me own hands."	"Speaker=Cranky"

"Lola_fallback_01"	"Don't be a stranger now, you hear."	"Speaker=Lola"

"Biff_fallback_00"	"Where's the welcome wagon, pardner?"	"Speaker=Biff"
"Biff_fallback_01"	"Biff is back! Yihaa!"	"Speaker=Biff"
"Biff_fallback_02"	"Haven't been back here since I was a young man. Hard times behind us now, though."	"Speaker=Biff"
"Biff_fallback_03"	"Word is you've brought a bit of a renaissance with you, sonny."	"Speaker=Biff"
"Biff_fallback_04"	"Biff Beacon goes wherever there's dollars at."	"Speaker=Biff"

"Biff_fallback_20"	"What'll it be, pardner?"	"Speaker=Biff"
"Biff_fallback_21"	"Low, low prices."	"Speaker=Biff"
"Biff_fallback_22"	"You won't need to haggle. Everything's already discounted."	"Speaker=Biff"
"Biff_fallback_23"	"Browse all you like, mister."	"Speaker=Biff"
"Biff_fallback_24"	"You won't find it no cheaper."	"Speaker=Biff"
"Biff_fallback_25"	"Who says quality comes at a price?"	"Speaker=Biff"

"Dandy_fallback_00"	"Welcome, dear sir."	"Speaker=Dandy"
"Dandy_fallback_01"	"I do believe you've been wasting away devoid of proper commercial alternatives."	"Speaker=Dandy"
"Dandy_fallback_02"	"Not to worry, good fellow."	"Speaker=Dandy"
"Dandy_fallback_03"	"Looking for impeccable wares and service? \nDandy Alexander is whom you seek."	"Speaker=Dandy"
"Dandy_fallback_04"	"It's about time someone brought a bit of class to this town."	"Speaker=Dandy"

"Dandy_fallback_21"	"Take a gander at our quality wares."	"Speaker=Dandy"
"Dandy_fallback_22"	"Since you're here, in my store, I presume you must have impeccable taste."	"Speaker=Dandy"

# ------ RUSTY ENTERS MINE AND TALKS TO JOE'S CORPSE.
"Rusty_enter_mine_01"	"*UMPH*"	"Speaker=Rusty"
"Rusty_enter_mine_02"	"Well, I don't reckon I'll get out the way I got in."	"Speaker=Rusty"
"Rusty_enter_mine_03"	"Could be part of my uncle's mine, I guess. All it needs is a splash of paint."	"Speaker=Rusty"
"Rusty_enter_mine_04"	"Better explore it before the rest of my light dwindles."	"Speaker=Rusty"

"Dorothy_in_mine_00"	"Say! What do you think you're doing?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Dorothy_in_mine_01"	"Your dramatic entrance just caved the roof in."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"Dorothy_in_mine_03"	"I'm sorry, miss."	"Speaker=Rusty"
"Dorothy_in_mine_04"	"My uncle sent me the claim to this mine."	"Speaker=Rusty"
"Dorothy_in_mine_05"	"I was heading to Tumbleton to find out why, when I fell through."	"Speaker=Rusty"

"Dorothy_in_mine_06"	"Oh... \nYou're Joe's nephew?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Dorothy_in_mine_07"	"He's been gone a while. \nI've been sneaking down here mining what little I can, and..."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Dorothy_in_mine_08"	"I just found him."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Dorothy_in_mine_09"	"I'm sorry..."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Dorothy_in_mine_10"	"You should go see for yourself."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Dorothy_in_mine_11"	"I'll wait here and try to find a way out."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"dead_miner_01"	"It's been a while uncle. Sorry I didn't make it here before you left us."	"Speaker=Rusty"
"dead_miner_02"	"You always claimed we were so much alike? \nCan't say I understand why you sent me the claim, though."	"Speaker=Rusty"
"dead_miner_03"	"I'm no miner."	"Speaker=Rusty"
"dead_miner_04"	"*Sigh* \nWell, I hate to rob you of your plunder."	"Speaker=Rusty"
"dead_miner_05"	"If I could just borrow your pickaxe, I might get out of this calaboose."	"Speaker=Rusty"

"Dorothy_in_mine_12"	"See you found a pickaxe. \nYou do look a proper miner with it."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Dorothy_in_mine_13"	"That's good. The lever opening the door out of here got buried when you dropped in."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Dorothy_in_mine_14"	"You'll have to clear out a tunnel below us to get to it."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"Dorothy_in_mine_15"	"You need to clear a tunnel down to the lever so we can get out of here."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

# ------ DOROTHY TELLS YOU TO OPEN UP THE MINE AGAIN.
"Pre_Dorothy1_00"	"You handled that mine like a real pro."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Pre_Dorothy1_01"	"Seeing as you're the new owner and all, maybe you should keep it open."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Pre_Dorothy1_02"	"Bring any ore you find back up to me and I'll give you a fair rate for it."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Pre_Dorothy1_03"	"This town sure can use it."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Pre_Dorothy1_04"	"I'm Dorothy by the way."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Pre_Dorothy1_05"	"Now, why don't you try mining some precious stones?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"Pre_Dorothy1_20"	"What've you got for me?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Pre_Dorothy1_21"	"Find anything good?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Pre_Dorothy1_22"	"Keep mining those valuables."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"Pre_Cranky1_00"	"Me friends call me Hank, or Cranky... \nYe can call me Mr. McCrank."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"Pre_Cranky1_01"	"Ye're going to want a better pickaxe."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"Pre_Cranky1_02"	"Well, we're fresh out of resources. The mine having been closed and all."	"Speaker=Cranky"

"Pre_Cranky1_20"	"If I was to open up shop again..."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"Pre_Cranky1_21"	"I would need some more resources."	"Speaker=Cranky"

"Pre_Lola1_00"	"Nice to see a new face in town. Especially such a handsome one."	"Speaker=Lola"
"Pre_Lola1_01"	"Don't get many newcomers. Folk are more likely to move in the other direction."	"Speaker=Lola"
"Pre_Lola1_02"	"So! You're our new miner."	""
"Pre_Lola1_03"	"Sorry to see old Joe finally go. He'd not looked well for some time now."	""
"Pre_Lola1_04"	"You're a quiet fellow, just like him, huh?"	"Speaker=Lola"
"Pre_Lola1_05"	"You just let me do the talking then."	"Speaker=Lola"

"Pre_Lola1_20"	"Nice to see a new face in town."	"Speaker=Lola"

# ------ YOU CAN NOW UPGRADE YOUR PICKAXE.
"Pre_Dorothy2_00"	"Looks like you're getting the hang of it."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Pre_Dorothy2_01"	"You should go see my daddy at the upgrade shop."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Pre_Dorothy2_02"	"He'll fix that pickaxe so you can dig even deeper. "	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"Pre_Dorothy2_03"	"No need to tell him you saw me down there earlier, though."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"Pre_Dorothy2_20"	"Go talk to my daddy about fixing that pickaxe of yours."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"Pre_Cranky2_00"	"Now I've got something to work with."	"Speaker=Cranky"

"Pre_Lola2_00"	"So, you're staying put?"	"Speaker=Lola"
"Pre_Lola2_01"	"That's nice."	"Speaker=Lola"

"Pre_Lola2_20"	"It's good to have someone mining here again."	"Speaker=Lola"

# ------ USE YOUR NEW PICKAXE AND EXPLORE THE FIRST CAVE.
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy1_00"	"That pickaxe should let you take on harder dirt, deeper down."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy1_01"	"When I was scavenging for ore I found something else too... A cave."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy1_02"	"You might want to check it out. Joe used to bring all sorts of stuff down there."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy1_03"	"Be careful, though."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy1_04"	"Critters have been a bit feisty since around the time he went missing."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy1_20"	"Keeping the mine open will really help this town."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy1_21"	"This town sure can use some growth."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy1_22"	"You had a chance to look into that cave I found?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy1_23"	"What've you got for me?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy1_24"	"Find anything good?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky1_00"	"So ye're keeping yer uncle's mine open? Dangerous place."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky1_01"	"Lost my leg to a Shiner, while fixing an old tube in them tunnels."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky1_02"	"Guess I could mend it myself but..."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky1_03"	"The cobbler's bairns are aye the worst shod, as we said in the old country."	"Speaker=Cranky; An old Scottish saying meaning: The shoemaker's children are the one's with the worst shoes. This means that if someone does something for a living they are usually quite bad at getting those things done at home."
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky1_04"	"Still, we're a mining town. Can't really get along without a mine, now."	"Speaker=Cranky"

# ------ YOU FOUND SOME SPEED BOOTS IN THE CAVE.
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy2_00"	"Dang! What's that on your feet?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy2_01"	"I've never seen anything quite like that."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy2_02"	"Did you find that in the cave? You think Joe left it there for you?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy2_03"	"Maybe there's more down in the mine somewhere?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy2_04"	"Did you show it to my father? You really should."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy2_20"	"Best exchange rate in town. Well, the only one."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy2_21"	"You'll find more valuable ore the deeper you get."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy2_22"	"What've you got for me?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy2_23"	"Find anything good?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky2_00"	"So, ye found one of Joe's caves, did ye?"	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky2_01"	"Don't know what unnatural stuff he was up to down there."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky2_02"	"Cogs and steam, that I get. He meddled with some weird things, he did."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky2_03"	"Sometimes I'd let him stack some of it here in me store. Weird glowing stuff."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky2_04"	"I'd rather seen him store it in the cave he dug deeper down."	"Speaker=Cranky"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola2_00"	"Those are some mighty fine boots you've gotten."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola2_01"	"Bet you're quick as a greased-in steam-hog with them on."	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola2_20"	"Strange looking, but fine boots, indeed."	"Speaker=Lola"

# ------ YOU'VE FOUND THE CHARGE JUMP IN THE SECOND CAVE.
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy3_00"	"Say, you found more of that strange technology."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy3_01"	"Weird how it just fits you like that."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy3_02"	"Like it's made for you."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy3_20"	"Back in the light again?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy3_21"	"Working hard, I see."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy3_22"	"What've you got for me?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy3_23"	"Find anything good?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky3_00"	"Ye went down there anyway? *Hrm*"	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky3_01"	"Pigheaded, just like yer uncle. He always went his own way too."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky3_02"	"If I can't dissuade ye, might as well help ye figure some of it out."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky3_03"	"Don't want me daughter having to shoulder the work of another lost miner."	"Speaker=Cranky"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola3_00"	"The short while Joe spent on the surface he'd hang around the bar."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola3_01"	"Usually by himself. Scribbling away at his notes."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola3_02"	"I found this old napkin he'd doodled on."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola3_03"	"Looks sort of like a map, don't it? He's marked something on it too."	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola3_20"	"You've gotten a chance to look at whatever's on that map?"	"Speaker=Lola"

# ------ YOU FOUND THE DRILL
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy4_00"	"Whoa! That drill looks really powerful. Enough to break really tough soil."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy4_01"	"You think that's what Joe wanted you to do?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy4_02"	"Break through to Old World below the mine."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy4_03"	"Bet there's riches down there."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy4_04"	"Nothing but Shiners there. Don't think they've any notion of valuable rock."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy4_05"	"This could mean a gold rush for Tumbleton."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy4_20"	"Have you broken through to Old World yet?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy4_21"	"I'll give you a fair price on anything you dig up."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy4_22"	"Must be all kinds of exciting, that deep down?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy4_23"	"Them Shiners don't scare us, no sir!"	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky4_00"	"Some parts look familiar on this drill; ye'll still need steam."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky4_01"	"Other parts are way beyond what I've seen before. "	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky4_02"	"Joe might've gotten his ideas down in Old World I guess."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky4_03"	"He did say Shiners were quite brilliant in ancient times..."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky4_04"	"Before they wrecked the world, that is."	"Speaker=Cranky"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola4_00"	"Never was much for company, old Joe."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola4_01"	"He spent all his time in the mine the last few years."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola4_02"	"Never brought much up, though."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola4_03"	"Like there were things got his attention more than precious rock down there."	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola4_20"	"Not an easy man to get close to, that old Joe."	"Speaker=Lola"

# ------ YOU'VE ENTERED Old World
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky5_00"	"So ye got into Old World? Dank and treacherous place."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky5_01"	"Ye cleared out that old pneumatic tube too?"	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky5_02"	"More reliable than those glowing, watchamacallits."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky5_03"	"Take care while exploring down there, though."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky5_04"	"Shiners can be quite dangerous."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky5_05"	"Not really the best place for a mine."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky5_06"	"Can't choose where you find a deposit, I guess."	"Speaker=Cranky"

# ------ YOU'VE FOUND THE FIRST UPGRADE IN Old World
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy6_00"	"The more of this stuff you dig up the more certain I get."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy6_01"	"Your uncle placed it there for you to find."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy6_02"	"Like a trail of breadcrumbs for you to follow."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy6_03"	"Getting you ready for something."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy6_20"	"I just knew there was treasure to be found in Old World."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy6_21"	"Still lots down there to dig up, eh?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy6_22"	"You're making progress."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy6_23"	"These new minerals sure will be great for the town's growth."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky6_00"	"There's scarce trace of the Shiners left up here."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky6_01"	"Seeing what humanity looks like nowadays, it's hard to share your uncle's beliefs."	"Speaker=Cranky"

"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky6_03"	"If true, what else were they capable of back then?"	"Speaker=Cranky"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola6_00"	"Haven't seen a Shiner up top since war times."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola6_01"	"Deranged and dangerous, they are. Thoroughly unpredictable."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola6_02"	"Not unlike most of my patrons."	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola6_20"	"They're not so different from us, those Shiners."	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Tumbleton_Biff6_00"	"That strange old miner that dug here before you."	"Speaker=Biff"
"conv_Tumbleton_Biff6_01"	"He always ordered some strange stuff."	"Speaker=Biff"
"conv_Tumbleton_Biff6_02"	"Useless things like twisted copper tubes and such nonsense."	"Speaker=Biff"

# ------ YOU'VE FOUND THE SECOND UPGRADE IN Old World
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy7_00"	"You'll be getting to the bottom of Old World soon."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy7_01"	"The end of the trail should be close."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy7_02"	"You see, beneath Old World it'll be way too hot for any Steambot to dig."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy7_20"	"You should hit bottom soon."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy7_21"	"Still at it?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy7_22"	"How far down does Old World stretch, you think?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy7_23"	"Can you feel the heat down there?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky7_00"	"I've been running this shop all me life."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky7_01"	"Technology don't evolve in leaps and bounds."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky7_02"	"It's gradual. One invention enables another."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky7_03"	"Not like the things ye're finding down there."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky7_04"	"Scares me a bit, I'll admit it."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky7_05"	"Not saying they're not useful, though."	"Speaker=Cranky"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola7_00"	"At times old Joe would be down in the mine for weeks."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola7_01"	"He must've gotten really deep down too."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola7_02"	"Once in a while we thought he'd stay down there for good."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola7_03"	"Proved us right in the end, didn't he?"	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola7_20"	"It's a sad thing to see Joe gone."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola7_21"	"Still, I think the mine is where he wanted to end up."	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Tumbleton_Biff7_00"	"Preparing for another trip down the tunnels, sonny?"	"Speaker=Biff"
"conv_Tumbleton_Biff7_01"	"Back before the war some of us boys would sneak down and play games of dare."	"Speaker=Biff"
"conv_Tumbleton_Biff7_02"	"Some would come back up and tell stories of glowing lights in the darkness."	"Speaker=Biff"
"conv_Tumbleton_Biff7_03"	"Trying to psych the rest of us out with ghost stories, most likely."	"Speaker=Biff"
"conv_Tumbleton_Biff7_04"	"You don't strike me as the kind scared of ghosts, though."	"Speaker=Biff"

# ------ YOU'VE FOUND THE LAST UPGRADE IN Old World AND ENTERED VECTRON.
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy8_00"	"What?! The mine goes even deeper?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy8_01"	"Is that frost on your armor? How is that even possible?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy8_02"	"Only thing supposed to be down at that depth is molten rock."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy8_03"	"Please be careful."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy8_04"	"Something must be cooling the earth down."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy8_05"	"You really should explore whatever's down there."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy8_20"	"Take care down there."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy8_21"	"This is highly precious."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy8_22"	"We'll make great use of this."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy8_23"	"I don't get it, it should be blistering below."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky8_00"	"I had no idea there was another tube down there."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky8_01"	"Proves yer uncle's been that deep at least."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky8_02"	"Might be, ye'll even find the source of Joe's knowledge down there."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky8_03"	"Ye'll have to tread carefully, though. This is strange stuff."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky8_04"	"Ye've not only opened a way down, ye know."	"Speaker=Cranky"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola8_00"	"You're a lot younger than Joe, and he'd not been all that well."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola8_01"	"Still, let's hope you're prepared for whatever you'll encounter."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola8_02"	"Good luck."	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola8_20"	"You do seem prepared to face the unknown."	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Tumbleton_Biff8_00"	"The deeper you dig the better off we'll all be, I say."	"Speaker=Biff"
"conv_Tumbleton_Biff8_01"	"Throw caution to the wind, pilgrim, and let that pick fly."	"Speaker=Biff"
"conv_Tumbleton_Biff8_02"	"Yihaa!"	"Speaker=Biff"

# ------ YOU'VE FOUND THE MINIMAP; YOU'VE BROKEN THROUGH THE FIRST BARRIER.
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy9_00"	"There are things living down there?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy9_01"	"What are they?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy9_02"	"Animals? You think they're smarter than that?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy9_20"	"This is very nice."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy9_21"	"We sure can make use of this new ore."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy9_22"	"This'll fetch a nice price."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy9_23"	"Have you found out anything more about the things living down there?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky9_00"	"This is even weirder than that technology ye found before."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky9_01"	"Not a single thing on this looks familiar. Some strange force driving it."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky9_02"	"The other stuff was just very advanced steam technology."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky9_03"	"This is something different altogether. I can't even figure out what it's supposed to do."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky9_04"	"I think I'll call it... Electricity."	"Speaker=Cranky"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola9_00"	"All these tools you're finding must make digging easier."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola9_01"	"Just take care of your insides too. A true heart is just as important."	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola9_20"	"Take care of that steam-heart."	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Tumbleton_Biff9_00"	"Sure are a lot of things unknown about what's down in those depths."	"Speaker=Biff"
"conv_Tumbleton_Biff9_01"	"Still, it's worth exploring. You found some great stuff so far, pardner."	"Speaker=Biff"
"conv_Tumbleton_Biff9_02"	"Don't look a gift steam-horse in the mouth, I always say."	"Speaker=Biff; A Steambot version of the saying: Never look a gift horse in the mouth. The meaning is that you should not complain over things you've gotten for free."

"conv_Tumbleton_Dandy9_00"	"Why would a single soul choose to dwell down there?"	"Speaker=Dandy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dandy9_01"	"In the dirt and dark."	"Speaker=Dandy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dandy9_02"	"I do believe they must all be somewhat simple, do you not agree?"	"Speaker=Dandy"


# ------ YOU'VE FOUND THE STATIC DASH. 
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy10_00"	"You're more new parts than old by now."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy10_01"	"How much more can you fit?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy10_02"	"I really wonder what Joe had in mind, sending you the deed..."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy10_03"	"Preparing the caves..."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy10_20"	"You sure look different."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy10_21"	"Still more to mine down there?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy10_22"	"Nice haul!"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy10_23"	"That's very uncommon ore."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky10_00"	"Technology in and of itself is not dangerous."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky10_01"	"How it's used is what defines it."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky10_02"	"That being said, the things down there give me the heebee jeebies."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky10_03"	"If ye don't know how it works, ye can't know the consequences."	"Speaker=Cranky"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola10_00"	"You've changed quite a bit since you first arrived."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola10_01"	"If all those add-ons are needed to dig this deep, however did Joe manage?"	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Tumbleton_Lola10_02"	"Digging that deep in his condition. No wonder he didn't make it back up."	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola10_20"	"You're like a new bot!"	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Tumbleton_Biff10_00"	"You remind me of a few people I met out there in the world."	"Speaker=Biff"
"conv_Tumbleton_Biff10_01"	"I'll tell you, no miner I've ever seen's got this look."	"Speaker=Biff"
"conv_Tumbleton_Biff10_02"	"More of a soldier air about you, pardner."	"Speaker=Biff"

"conv_Tumbleton_Dandy10_00"	"Smashing look, dear fellow."	"Speaker= Dandy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dandy10_01"	"Bold and new."	"Speaker=Dandy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dandy10_02"	"Nice to see displacement of the norm in what passes for fashion here."	"Speaker= Dandy"

# ------ DOROTHY SENDS YOU TO DESTROY GENERATORS.
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy11_00"	"That door might well hold what you've come here for."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy11_01"	"If there are three barriers, there should be three generators, right?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy11_02"	"You'll need to locate all of them."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy11_03"	"How about taking a look in the upper layers too?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy11_04"	"Might be what's been riling the critters so?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy11_20"	"Find those generators yet?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy11_21"	"You're like a mining machine. Literally."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy11_22"	"Wonder what's behind that door?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"


"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky11_00"	"Ye have no way of knowing what that door blocks."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky11_01"	"Might be Joe wanted ye to open it? That's why he sent ye the deed."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky11_02"	"Could be some horrible power on the other side of it."	"Speaker=Cranky"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola11_00"	"You do have to wonder how Joe did all this on his own."	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Tumbleton_Lola11_20"	"How could that old man manage what he did?"	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Tumbleton_Biff11_00"	"That door might be the way to unimaginable riches."	"Speaker=Biff"
"conv_Tumbleton_Biff11_01"	"Minerals pressed into the most fantastic materials."	"Speaker=Biff"

"conv_Tumbleton_Dandy11_00"	"Heavens! Look at that desert flower running the exchange shop."	"Speaker= Dandy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dandy11_01"	"A bit unsophisticated perhaps..."	"Speaker=Dandy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dandy11_02"	"Though, with cheekplates like that, all she needs is a bit of polish."	"Speaker= Dandy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dandy11_03"	"I might be able to finesse this place into proper society after all."	"Speaker= Dandy"

# ------ YOU DESTROYED THE OTHER GENERATORS IN Old World AND ARCHAEA; DOOR IS OPEN.
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy12_00"	"You do look well prepared."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy12_01"	"No reason to wait any longer."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy12_02"	"Go open that door."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy12_20"	"Open that door."	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Tumbleton_Dorothy12_21"	"You'll soon know what your uncle was up to."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky12_00"	"It's your decision now, lad."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Tumbleton_Cranky12_01"	"Hope you're ready for whatever's behind that door."	"Speaker=Cranky"

# ------ EPILOGUE
"conv_Epilogue_00"	"There, it is finished. Behold! My masterpiece."	"Speaker=Dandy"

"conv_Epilogue_01"	"What... I thought it was supposed to be a statue of Rusty."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Epilogue_02"	"He was the one who saved this town from them demons after all."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Epilogue_03"	"Not this..."	"Speaker=Lola"
"conv_Epilogue_04"	"What is this anyway, a scrap metal monkey?"	"Speaker=Lola"

"conv_Epilogue_05"	"*Sigh* Is it not obvious?"	"Speaker=Dandy"
"conv_Epilogue_06"	"It is the abstraction of a destructible Steambot acquiring godhood."	"Speaker=Dandy"

"conv_Epilogue_07"	"It sort of resembles me poor father... after he was run over by a freight train."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Epilogue_07b"	"Bless his soul."	"Speaker=Cranky"

"conv_Epilogue_08"	"My sensibilities for the finer things in life are altogether wasted here."	"Speaker=Dandy"
"conv_Epilogue_09"	"Without Rusty, this place is exhaustively devoid of class."	"Speaker=Dandy"

"conv_Epilogue_10"	"Why do we even need this monument?"	"Speaker=Dorothy"
"conv_Epilogue_11"	"We still haven't done a proper search down there."	"Speaker=Dorothy"

"conv_Epilogue_12"	"A month, he's been missing now, honey."	"Speaker=Cranky"
"conv_Epilogue_13"	"The cataclysm down there destroyed everything beneath Old World."	"Speaker=Cranky"
